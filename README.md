# 3D Robot Legs
I designed 3D robot legs using Tinkercad, as part of a mechanical engineering track.ðŸ¤–

## Purpose
The purpose of this task is to learn how to design robot legs using 3D modeling and prepare them for printing using a 3D printer.

## Design Process Overview
### 1. Foot Design
- Created the foundational structure of the foot.

### 2. Knee Joint Design
- Engineered the crucial knee joint for flexibility and support.

### 3. Top Fixed Part Design
- Finalized the upper fixed component for structural integrity.

For the second leg, I replicated the entire structure, maintaining identical dimensions and alignment for symmetry and balance.
